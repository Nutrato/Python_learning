# Python_learning
This is me, Trying to learn Phython. 
I feel it is good practice to record or save whenever you are learning new things.
In future, for what so ever reason if you leave the learing course, it will help you to come back and pick up right from where you left off.
So I'll be saving each program that learn and explain what it will do.
